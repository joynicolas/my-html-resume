    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            As a skilled Graphic Designer who has now transitioned into UX Design, I am dedicated to creating innovative user experiences. Recently, I completed the prestigious Human Factors International Certified Usability Analyst (CUA) program in December 2021, adding to my expertise in designing user-centric interfaces.<br/> 
            <br/>My diverse project portfolio spans across various domains, including healthcare, sports, food, job portals, and government projects. I am always eager to explore new opportunities to refine my skills and expand my knowledge base.<br/>
            <br/>I understand that the process of UX design involves a series of steps, from ideation to design handoff. However, my experience has taught me that each organization follows its unique approach, ranging from traditional to modern methods. As a UX Designer, it is my responsibility to adapt to these approaches and communicate the significance of user experience to all stakeholders involved. Getting to know an organization's work, customers, projects, and clients is a vital part of making the design journey more engaging and productive.
